## Educational Context

This application demonstrates several scholarly approaches to dating early Christian literature:

- **Traditional View**: Accepts traditional authorship and early dating
- **Critical Scholarship**: Questions authorship of some letters, dates them later
- **Moderate Position**: Attempts to balance both perspectives

The different versions of split letters (like 2 Corinthians and Philippians) reflect actual scholarly theories about how these texts were compiled from multiple original letters.
